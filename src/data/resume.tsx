    "Crafting Beautiful and Engaging Digital Experiences with Love and Code.",
  summary: `I'm Mayur Nalwala, a design-oriented front-end developer passionate about creating pixel-perfect, engaging, and accessible digital experiences. My journey began in 2014 when I first dabbled in creating websites using Bootstrap. What started as an experiment quickly became a deep dive into the vast and exciting world of coding and web development.

Over the years, I've had the privilege of building websites and web applications for agencies, start-ups, and large corporations, always striving to find that sweet spot where design meets engineering. I believe that the best digital experiences are not only visually appealing but also built with solid engineering principles.

I like helping new developers and working with emerging startups to bring their ideas to life. Outside of work, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through articles on my blog, [webexpe.com](https://webexpe.com/), and creating fun dev memes for Instagram.

Let's build something amazing together!`,
